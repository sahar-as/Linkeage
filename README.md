# Linkeage
Linkage is a sample of cloud programming, implemented in Java and using Firebase for the cloud part. It is not a completed application. I have developed it as a resume. The current version will authorize users via their phone number and send them an OTP message. After Authentication, you would remain login into the application until you log out.
In the Contact menu, you can see all your contact members who installed this application and you are able to send them a message. 
In the Create Group menu, you can create a new group and add people to it, with the ability to choose a name and picture for it.
Here is some pictures related to the Linkage application:
